{"title":"🌟 Contributing Guidelines","markdown":{"headingText":"🌟 Contributing Guidelines","containsRefs":false,"markdown":"\nThank you for your interest in contributing to this project! We welcome all kinds of contributions—code, documentation, ideas, and more. This guide will help you get started.\n\n---\n\n## 🚀 How to Contribute\n\n1. **Fork this repository**  \n   Click the **Fork** button at the top right of this page to create your own copy.\n\n2. **Clone your fork**  \n   Open your terminal and run:  \n   ```bash\n   git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/Template.git\n   cd Template\n   ```\n\n3. **Create a new branch**  \n   Give your branch a descriptive name:  \n   ```bash\n   git checkout -b my-feature-branch\n   ```\n\n4. **Make your changes**  \n   Add your code, documentation, or other contributions.\n\n5. **Commit your changes**  \n   ```bash\n   git add .\n   git commit -m \"Describe your changes\"\n   ```\n\n6. **Push to your fork**  \n   ```bash\n   git push origin my-feature-branch\n   ```\n\n7. **Open a Pull Request (PR)**  \n   - Go to your fork on GitHub.\n   - Click **Compare & pull request**.\n   - Fill out the PR template and submit.\n\n---\n\n## 💡 Using Issue & PR Templates\n\n- When reporting a bug or requesting a feature, please use the provided **issue templates** for clear and helpful reports.\n- When submitting a pull request, fill out the **PR template** to describe your changes and link related issues.\n\n---\n\n## ✨ Acknowledging Contributors with All Contributors Bot\n\nWe celebrate all contributions! 🎉  \nWe use the [All Contributors Bot](https://allcontributors.org/) to recognize everyone’s work—code, docs, ideas, design, and more.\n\n### How to Get Acknowledged\n\n- After your PR is merged, comment on an issue or PR:\n  ```\n  @all-contributors please add @your-username for code, doc\n  ```\n  (Replace `@your-username` and the contribution types as appropriate.)\n\n- The bot will open a PR to update the contributors table in the README.  \n- Review and merge that PR to see your avatar and contributions appear!\n\n### Contribution Types\n\nSee the [emoji key](https://allcontributors.org/docs/en/emoji-key) for all the ways you can be recognized.\n\n---\n## GitHub Access and Team Setup\n\nWe have completed the setup of GitHub access and team structures for the **IMAGO Project**.  \nEach product team now has its own dedicated GitHub team, and all members have been assigned accordingly.\n\n🔗 **Teams Directory:** [IMAGO GitHub Teams](https://github.com/orgs/Imago-SDRUK/teams)\n\n---\n\n## Team and Repository Structure\n- Each **product team** has a corresponding **private repository**.  \n- Teams are responsible for maintaining their own repositories.  \n- When a repository is ready to be shared publicly, it will be made available for everyone.  \n\n---\n\n## Access Policy\n- All organization members have access to both **public** and **private** repositories within the IMAGO Project.\n---\n\n## Offboarding Process\nWhen a member leaves the **IMAGO Project**:\n- Their membership will be converted to an **Outside Collaborator**.  \n- They will retain access only to the **repositories (public or private)** they contributed to.  \n- They will no longer be listed as a member of the organization.\n\n---\n\n## 🐛 Reporting Issues\n\n- **Search** existing issues before opening a new one.\n- Use the **bug** or **feature request** templates.\n- Provide a clear title, description, and steps to reproduce (if applicable).\n- Screenshots and error messages are helpful!\n\n---\n\n## 🔄 Resolving Merge Conflicts\n\nSometimes, your PR may have conflicts with the main branch. To resolve:\n\n1. Fetch the latest changes:\n   ```bash\n   git checkout main\n   git pull origin main\n   git checkout my-feature-branch\n   git merge main\n   ```\n2. Fix any conflicts in your files (look for `<<<<<<<`, `=======`, `>>>>>>>` markers).\n3. Add and commit the resolved files:\n   ```bash\n   git add .\n   git commit -m \"Resolve merge conflicts\"\n   ```\n4. Push your branch again:\n   ```bash\n   git push origin my-feature-branch\n   ```\n\n---\n\n## 💬 Code of Conduct\n\nBe respectful and considerate in all interactions.  \nSee our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) for details.\n\n---\n  \nWe appreciate your contributions and support in building a vibrant community around this project.
