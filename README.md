# Satellite Embeddings Workshop

This workshop is part of the project **Embedding embeddings across social research and policy (EMBED2Social)**. The aim of EMBED2Social is to accelerate and widen the adoption of image embedding technology in applied contexts, in order to unlock the potential of satellite data for research, policy, and decision-making.

This is a hands-on workshop introducing satellite (geo-)embeddings and their practical applications, co-organised by Imago and MHCLG. The workshop focuses on how satellite embeddings can be used in real-world tasks such as semantic search, unsupervised learning, and predictive modelling, with live coding sessions in Python.

## Workshop Details

**Date:** Tuesday 27th January 2026  
**Time:** 10:00 – 16:30  
**Location:**  
2 Marsham Street, London, SW1P 4DF  
Room FG46  

Key highlights include:

- What geo-embeddings are and why they matter  
- How to work with embeddings in practical, real-world scenarios  
- Techniques for semantic search and predictive modelling  
- Hands-on Python labs using satellite data  

## Schedule

| 10:00 – 11:00 | Lecture I: What are geo-embeddings and why should I care |
| 11:00 – 11:15 | Coffee break |
| 11:15 – 12:30 | Lab I: Exploring geo-embeddings in the real world |
| 12:30 – 13:30 | Lunch |
| 13:30 – 14:30 | Lecture II: Where and how can I use geo-embeddings? |
